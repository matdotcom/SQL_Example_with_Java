## SQL example with java.

### This program allows you to enter an sql server and create databases & tables & stuff.

### Also allows you to insert data into tables, and has exceptions in case any errors occur. 

### It's currently using localhost and root as the user, but you can modify the program in any way you like, i have written several comments, over the methods.
